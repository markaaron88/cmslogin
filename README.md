CST363 Midterm Group Project
Created course management system (CMS) a web application course management system (CMS) that allows users to log into; based on
their user level (student, teacher, administrator), they receive different informational
views relevant to their needs. Students will receive access to their course list, and
individual grade. Teachers will be able to view grades for all their students. The
administrator will be able to create new accounts, but not view courses or grades. The
project is centered around displaying different information based on account access
levels.
