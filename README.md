CST363 Midterm Group Project-
Created a course management system (CMS) web applicaton that allows users to log into; based on their user level (student, teacher, administrator), they receive different informational views relevant to their needs.Students will receive access to their course list, andindividual grade. Teachers will be able to view grades for all their students. The
administrator will be able to create new accounts, but not view courses or grades. The
project is centered around displaying different information based on account access
